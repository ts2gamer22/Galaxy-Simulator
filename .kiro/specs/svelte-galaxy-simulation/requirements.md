# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a Svelte web application that displays an interactive 3D galaxy simulation using Three.js. The application will render a visually appealing galaxy with stars, spiral arms, and interactive controls, providing users with an immersive astronomical visualization experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view a 3D galaxy simulation in my web browser, so that I can explore and appreciate the structure of a galaxy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display a 3D galaxy with visible spiral arms
2. WHEN the galaxy is rendered THEN the system SHALL show thousands of individual stars distributed in a realistic spiral pattern
3. WHEN the simulation starts THEN the system SHALL animate the galaxy rotation at a configurable speed
4. IF the browser supports WebGL THEN the system SHALL use hardware acceleration for smooth rendering

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to interact with the galaxy simulation, so that I can explore different perspectives and details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use mouse controls THEN the system SHALL allow me to orbit around the galaxy
2. WHEN I scroll with the mouse wheel THEN the system SHALL zoom in and out of the galaxy
3. WHEN I drag with the mouse THEN the system SHALL rotate the camera view smoothly
4. WHEN I interact with the simulation THEN the system SHALL maintain smooth frame rates above 30 FPS

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to customize the galaxy appearance, so that I can adjust the visualization to my preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the control panel THEN the system SHALL provide sliders for galaxy rotation speed
2. WHEN I adjust controls THEN the system SHALL allow me to modify the number of visible stars
3. WHEN I change settings THEN the system SHALL update the galaxy appearance in real-time
4. WHEN I modify colors THEN the system SHALL allow me to change star colors and galaxy core brightness

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application built with modern web technologies, so that it's maintainable and performant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is built THEN the system SHALL use Svelte as the primary framework
2. WHEN 3D rendering is needed THEN the system SHALL integrate Three.js for WebGL operations
3. WHEN the app is deployed THEN the system SHALL be responsive across desktop and tablet devices
4. WHEN users access the app THEN the system SHALL load within 3 seconds on modern browsers

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the galaxy to look realistic, so that I can have an educational and visually appealing experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the galaxy renders THEN the system SHALL display a bright central bulge with dimmer outer regions
2. WHEN stars are generated THEN the system SHALL use different star colors based on stellar classification
3. WHEN the galaxy rotates THEN the system SHALL simulate differential rotation with inner parts moving faster
4. WHEN viewing the galaxy THEN the system SHALL include subtle particle effects for cosmic dust and nebulae
